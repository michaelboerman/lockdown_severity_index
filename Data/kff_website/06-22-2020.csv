"Notes"
"For purposes of this table, states were included if they mandated the listed actions. A number of states released guidance or recommendations related to the actions listed in this table but fell short of issuing a requirement and are thus not included."


Footnotes
"1. Beginning in June, AK (6/6), FL (6/5), ME (6/8), and HI (6/16) provide exceptions to the mandatory traveler quarantine based on COVID test results (AK, ME), purpose of interstate travel (FL), travel from certain states (ME), or interisland travel (HI)."
"2. CA is allowing counties to submit attestation forms for variance from the statewide order, permitting them to open certain sectors more quickly as long as they meet certain criteria."
"3. These states did not formally issue stay at home orders; however, other actions, including closing non-essential businesses, banning large gatherings, and issuing advisories urging residents to stay home, had the same effect. For these states, rolling back such measures is listed as easing/lifting the stay at home order."
"4. The gathering ban listed for these states refers to the lowest indoor limit in a majority of the state; there are higher limits for outdoor or other settings."
"5. In CT, bars remain closed."
"6. Further social distancing rollbacks are in place in all but three FL counties, where county officials can request approval from the governor for further reopenings."
"7. Effective 5/18, residents are premitted to engage in more activities outside the home."
"8. Large gatherings of up to 250 people are permitted."
"9. Iowa limits gatherings to 50% of indoor or outdoor venue capacity and requires social distancing of 6 feet; if these requirements cannot be met, gatherings are limited to 10 people."
"10. The state is making recommendations for easing social distancing measures, but has delegated decisionmaking authority to the local level."
"11. All retail businesses can reopen with capacity limits in 13 rural counties."
"12. Local jurisdictions are permitted to impose tighter restrictions."
"13. Retail stores, office work that cannot be performed remotely, and restaurants with limited seating capacity may reopen in two of the state's eight regions."
"14. NE has implemented less restrictive orders that allow restaurants to re-open with capacity limits in 13 of its 19 local health districts."
"15. NJ limits gatherings indoors to 25% of room capacity, not to be greater than 100 people or smaller than 10 people, and gatherings outdoors to 250 people. All attendees must wear face masks and maintain six feet of distance."
"16. Additional non-essential businesses have been allowed to reopen in seven out of ten regions. Restaurants have also been allowed to reopen for outdoor service only in the same seven regions."
"17. NY had previously cancelled its primary election until a court order mandated it be held."
"18. There are three counties in OR that remain in phase 1 in which fewer non-essential businesses can reopen and large gatherings of more than 25 people are banned. One county in OR has not entered phase 1 yet, so non-essential businesses there remain closed, large gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, and restaurants remain closed."
"19. Although most of PA counties are in the Green Phase, 12 out of 67 counties remain in the Yellow Phase. In counties in the Yellow Phase, some non-essential businesses remain closed, large gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited, and restaurant service is limited to outdoor only."
"20. TN has implemented less restrictive orders that allow non-essential businesses and restaurants to reopen in 89 of the state’s 95 counties."
"21. Most counties are in the Yellow Phase (low risk) with the exception of Salt Lake City which is still in the Orange Phase (moderate). Nine counties are now in the Greeen (new normal) phase."
"22. Travel without quarantine restrictions is allowed to and from the counties of ME, NH, MA, RI, CT, and NY with 400 or fewer active cases of COVID-19 per million."
"23. Although most of the state is in Phase 2, some counties have been approved to move to Phase 3."
"24. Gatherings larger than five people are prohibited, except in counties that are in Phase 3."
"25. All social distancing restrictions were lifted by a WI Supreme Court ruling, not a decision by the Governor."

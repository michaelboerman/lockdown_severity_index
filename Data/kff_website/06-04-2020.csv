"Notes"
"* Reflects an easing of more restrictive social distancing measures."

"For purposes of this table, states were included if they mandated the listed actions. A number of states released guidance or recommendations related to the actions listed in this table but fell short of issuing a requirement and are thus not included."


Footnotes
"1. Effective 5/14, AR made traveler quarantine mandatory for those arriving from certain states."
"2. These states did not formally issue stay at home orders; however, other actions, including closing non-essential businesses, banning large gatherings, and issuing advisories urging residents to stay home, had the same effect. For these states, rolling back such measures is listed as easing/lifting the stay at home order."
"3. The gathering ban listed for these states refers to the lowest indoor limit in a majority of the state; there are higher limits for outdoor or other settings."
"4. The FL governor has prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people in public spaces, but limits on private gatherings have fallen short of a mandate."
"5. Effective 5/18, residents are premitted to engage in more activities outside the home."
"6. Large gatherings of up to 100 people are permitted."
"7. Iowa limits gatherings to 50% of indoor or outdoor venue capacity and requires social distnacing of 6 feet; if these requirements cannot be met, gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people."

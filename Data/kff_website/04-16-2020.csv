"3. CT, RI, and WV have prohibited gatherings larger than five people, with limited exceptions."
"4. The FL governor has prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people in public spaces, but limits on private gatherings have fallen short of a mandate."
"5. Governors in GA, IA, LA, ND, and VA have closed many, but not all, non-essential businesses."
"6. Iowa bans all gatherings in 14 hard-hit counties in the northeastern part of the state, and bans gatherings of more than 10 people in the rest of the state"

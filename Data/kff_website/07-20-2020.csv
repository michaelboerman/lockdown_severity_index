Footnotes
"1. The category totals for state face covering requirements may sum to more than 51 as some states may impose more than one type of requirement."
"2. Beginning in June, AK (6/6), FL (6/5), ME (6/8), and HI (6/16) provide exceptions to the mandatory traveler quarantine based on COVID test results (AK, ME), purpose of interstate travel (FL), travel from certain states (ME), or interisland travel (HI)."
"3. New mandatory closures of indoor operations of restaurants, entertainment facilities, zoos, and museums, as well as all operations of bars, are in effect statewide; new mandatory closures of indoor operations of personal care services, fitness centers, malls, non-essential offices, protests, and worship services are in effect in 30 counties."
"4. In addition to employees, these states require patrons/visitors in limited sectors to wear face coverings."
"5. These states did not formally issue stay at home orders; however, other actions, including closing non-essential businesses, banning large gatherings, and issuing advisories urging residents to stay home, had the same effect. For these states, rolling back such measures is listed as easing/lifting the stay at home order."
"6. The gathering ban listed for these states refers to the lowest indoor limit in a majority of the state; there are higher limits for outdoor or other settings."
"7. Further social distancing rollbacks are in place in all but three FL counties, where county officials can request approval from the governor for further reopenings."
"8. GA's governor issued an order prohibiting local governments from imposing face covering mandates that are more restrictive from the statewide policy."
"9. On 7/3, IN moved to stage 4.5 of reopening instead of stage 5; capacity limits on certain businesses remain in place, while fairs and conventions were allowed to resume."
"10. Large gatherings of up to 250 people are permitted."
"11. Iowa limits gatherings to 50% of indoor or outdoor venue capacity and requires social distancing of 6 feet; if these requirements cannot be met, gatherings are limited to 10 people."

"16. Retail stores, office work that cannot be performed remotely, and restaurants with limited seating capacity may reopen in two of the state's eight regions."
"17. Bars are closed for indoor service, but may still have outdoor service. Two of the state's eight regions are exempt from the closures."

"19. Face coverings are required in public indoor spaces and for organized outdoor activities when social distancing is not possible in counties with four or more active cases."
"20. NE has implemented less restrictive orders that allow restaurants to re-open with capacity limits in 13 of its 19 local health districts."
"21. Bars in counties determined to have Elevated Disease Transmission shall close, and restaurants in those counties will revert to Phase I service limitations. Currently, the order affects seven of 16 counties in Nevada."
"22. NJ limits gatherings indoors to 25% of room capacity, not to be greater than 100 people or smaller than 10 people, and gatherings outdoors to 500 people. All attendees must wear face masks and maintain six feet of distance."
"23. Seven out of ten regions in NY are in Phase IV, which allows for large gatherings of up to 50 people. Gatherings are limited to 25 people in regions that remain in Phase III."
"24. NY had previously cancelled its primary election until a court order mandated it be held."
"25. Face masks required for the general public in counties that have a very high risk of exposure and spread."
"26. There are three counties in OR that remain in phase 1 in which fewer non-essential businesses can reopen and large gatherings of more than 25 people are banned. One county in OR has not entered phase 1 yet, so non-essential businesses there remain closed, large gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, and restaurants remain closed."
"27. TN has implemented less restrictive orders that allow non-essential businesses and restaurants to reopen in 89 of the state’s 95 counties."
"28. Face masks required in counties with more than 20 COVID-19 cases."
"29. Most counties are in the Yellow Phase (low risk) with the exception of Salt Lake City which is still in the Orange Phase (moderate). Ten counties are now in the Greeen (new normal) phase."
"30. Travel without quarantine restrictions is allowed to and from the counties of ME, NH, MA, RI, CT, and NY with 400 or fewer active cases of COVID-19 per million."
